## Welcome to the Fossiverse!

The fossiverse aims at solving some of the biggest problems of FOSS software:
- one single entry point and sign on for multiple products
- SLT: Single Look Trust
  - be certain to have the best selection
  - interoperability with the rest of the Fossiverse
  - trust the code or check it by yourself
- a userbase for non-profit products that depend on it

Provide a counter meassure to greedy big-corp dictating the market by spending enough ressources on advertiesment. Leveraging a common userbase among the Fossiverse applications that depend on having a community. 

Developing a marketplace/ride sharing/social media that is and stays free for ever, protects the users, doesn't sell the users data and is fun to use.

Join now and define the future.
